The AMS purchased this building, transforming it into a 27-bed non-profit hospital, the first to serve the black community in Detroit. The name was chosen to honor the black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. Dunbar Hospital moved its operations out in 1928, and this building would become the home of Charles C. Diggs, Sr. and, later, his son Charles, Jr., the first black congressmen from Michigan. The Allied Medical Society's successor, the Detroit Medical Society, purchased the building in 1980 and continues to use it as their headquarters.",

Repeated drug-related issues at the theater caused it to close back down in the mid-1970s, and it was reopened as a short-lived music hall under the name Showcase Theatre. It then hosted plays for the Detroit Center for the Performing Arts in the 80s and 90s, raves in the mid-to-late 90s, and a church in the 2000s.

		  "notes": "Trolley parks were recreation areas popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and placed at the end of streetcar lines; the most famous trolley park is likely Coney Island in New York. For Detroit, the most popular trolley parks were situated in the area of East Jefferson and Grand River, near the bridge entrance to Belle Isle, and Palace Gardens Amusement Park was one of the longest-lived. Opened in 1905 as Wolff's Park, after the original owner, Morris Wolff, and was renamed Riverview Park in 1907. After the Albert Kahn-designed Palais de Dance pavilion, seen at the center of this photograph, opened, it was again renamed the Palace Gardens, though it was still known colloquially as Riverview. All of the trolley parks in this area fell into disrepair towards the end of the 1920s, and the city condemned and demolished them to make room for what would become Gabriel Richard Park.",

The park closed during World Wars I and II over concerns that the city's water supply could be compromised, and the lack of regular maintenance resulted in the tower falling into disrepair and being demolished in 1945.

In 1946, after financial struggles, the Webster was sold to Wayne University, who intended to use the building as a dormitory. After a great deal of resistance from a contingent of the hotel's permanent residents, many of which were World War I or II veterans, the Webster became the Wayne University Student Center Building. It was renamed Mackenzie Hall in honor of the University's founder, David Mackenzie, in 1961, and served primarily as faculty offices after the new student center building was finished in 1969. The building was demolished in 1991 in order to construct the parking structure which now stands in its place.",

Though segregation of school was not allowed by law following the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, many school districts were still segregated due to decades of residential segregation on the part of real estate agents, neighborhood associations, and others. One attempt to rectify this was the busing of students between majority-black and majority-white schools in Detroit and its suburbs. Following the 1974 Milliken v. Bradley supreme court case, brought about due to an NAACP lawsuit filed against Michigan state officials, it was established that schools were not obligated to desegregate unless school district lines were drawn with \"racist intent.\" Regardless, the busing system was largely a failure, as many families either moved or turned to private schooling rather than participate.",
